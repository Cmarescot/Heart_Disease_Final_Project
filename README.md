## Description of the tool that will be used to create the final dashboard
For our final dashboard, we have chosen to use Tableau Story. We are currently planning to have 4 graphs from our data.
The link to our dashboard can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/shared/MS36YCW7T?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
## Description of interactive element
Our interactive elements will include filters on each graph for different factors such as age and sex. We plan for each graph to have at least one filter and the color will coded based on the factor rather than the count.
